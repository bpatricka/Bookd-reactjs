# Bookd-reactjs
## Book'd started as a Python, Flask-based web application.

> *However,* we soon realized Python could not handle the client's requests as effectively as React.

------

#### Thus, Bookd-reactjs was born.

Book'd is a scholarly project developed by Brian Arbachouskas and Dylan Barton for SCSU Senior Capstone Project CSC400 with Dr. Alaa Sheta for the client SCSU Hilton Buley Library.
